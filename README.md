# Deep Learning Garbage Classification

## Description
This project classifies images of garbage into different categories using deep learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains labeled images of garbage (plastic, paper, metal, etc.)
- Dataset canbe found on Kaggle with the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumn2u/garbage-classification-v2

## Features / Steps Implemented
- Image preprocessing
- Data augmentation
- Model building: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras/TensorFlow
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation: accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix
